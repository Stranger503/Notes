# StudyLess StudySmart
2. Study on periods of half an hour and then go away and do whatever enjoyable thing you want for 5 minutes. Return to your desk and repeat (I personally find more useful the 50-10-50-10 minutes combo).

2. Have a desk especially for studying. Have a room especially for studying and working on your projects. Have a lamp, a chair, anything especially for studying. Don´t do other things in that environment. Go to other room or chair whenever you finish studying or working. Doing this makes your brain associate that environment with productivity, studying and working.

3. Don't listen to music not designed especially for studying purposes (even classical one) while you're studying. This is because you will find yourself giving part of your attention to the music or the lyrics, and you don't want to do that. Be focused in only one thing at a time.

4. Learn to differentiate between concepts and facts. Facts can be forgotten. It´s natural. But the things you really wanna learn and keep in your mind are the concepts. How does it works, what is the function of it, how does it connect to other concepts; that´s where you wanna struggle with.

5. Learning something is about to put a concept in your own words. To be able to explain that concept to a friend, a partner of studying, whoever asks you for an explanation.

6. TAKE Notes! Your brain is not a Hard Drive.

7. Realize the difference between recognition and recollection. Our brains are extremely good "remembering" things (only recognizing) when we read again a passage after we virtually forgot it. The prove that you didn´t remember that is that you would´nt have idea of that content without the help that brought that old idea into your memory.

8. Sleep good. That´s the main way the brain consolidates long term memory into a permanent memory.

9. About notes. Right after class take 5-10 minutes to read and expand the notes. Make them deeper and explain the thing with your own words. If you don´t have anyone to explain or talk about it, write it down. That´s a very important factor on getting useless notes into usable notes.

10. Teach another person. If you´re teaching and you don´t remember something or you can´t get into a good explanation, then you know where are the gaps of information that you have and what do you have to study again or ask the teacher the next day. If you can´t or you don´t have anyone next to you, teach an empty chair. That´s nothing wrong with speaking out loud to nobody if you realize what you are doing. Or, again, write it down. Make a dialogue with an imaginary friend who asks questions and you have to answer those.

11. Textbooks. Use the SQ3R method: Survey, Question, Read, Recite and Review. First, you wanna know a textbook isn´t a novel. You can go to the last page and I guarantee you nobody will discover who killed the main character.
You can follow this path:

a) take a brief look to the chapter you wanna study, watch the images, look what is all going to be about.

b) Look for the main questions. Does the textbook have some questions at the end of a section or a chapter? Write them down. At least, remember them (but having both things in your brain [trying to remember the main questions and studying at the same time may be very hard to do] Or you can use the Closure Effect in your favor). Even if you write them, have those questions in your mind so when you´re reading the textbook you can find the answers and know what is important and what is not.

c) Read the bold words. Titles, sub-titles, names, main ideas, everything that is marked. If the author and editor market that, it means they want you to read and keep that information on particular.

d) Read the first and last sentence in every paragraph. It just works (not always, but if the paragraph is long, it will be useful). If the textbook is well written, the first sentence in the paragraph will be an introduction of the idea of the paragraph, and the last sentence will be an overview of what was all about. With that in mind, all your outlook of the topic will expand and there you´ll be ready for:

e) Read the whole thing.

f) Try to answer the questions you made before. If you can´t, don´t worry, because the next step is:

g) Re-read the chapter. This time with a marker and a pencil in your hands. You can mark, now that you know what are you looking for, the actual main ideas, and take notes in the edge of the page.

h) Finish answering the questions you made before, make new ones (you know what are the important topics you want to have an answer for), and

i) Make anything you want to explain the topic to a children. You have to explain it in your own words, using simple language a 6-year-old kid would understand. You can write a complete essay pretending being an expert on the topic, and every time you feel gaps in your explanation, go read the material again.

When you have your study done, you´ll have 3 materials to work with: a) a textbook with useful marks and edge-page notes, b) a list of the main questions of the topic answered, and c) an essay (or mind map, whatever) made entirely by you, explaining all of it from zero to one hundred percent.

12. Recall. Between each of the steps of last point (a to i), you may consider taking 30 seconds to one minute trying to remember everything you learned before only with your mind (close your eyes if you want). Try to remember as close as the original material as you can. Once you finished, go to the next step and repeat

13. Use mnemonics. If you struggle with knowing which of which two different, but similar words, is the one which does something, and if is that of the other one which does the opposite thing, use acronyms, associate those concepts with images, a coined phrase; be creative. That´s a good way to remember a very particular group of facts.
