## atoi()
In the C Programming Language, the atoi function converts a string to an integer. The atoi function skips all white-space characters at the beginning of the string, converts the subsequent characters as part of the number, and then stops when it encounters the first character that isn't a number.

## strcmp()
The C library function int strcmp(const char *str1, const char *str2) compares the string pointed to, by str1 to the string pointed to by str2.

- The strcmp() function compares two strings and returns 0 if both strings are identical.
- int strcmp (const char* str1, const char* str2);
- The strcmp() function takes two strings and returns an integer.
- The strcmp() compares two strings character by character.
- It is defined in the **string.h** header file.

## Lex
Specify all pattern matching rule.

## Yacc
Specify Grammer rules.

Yacc reads the grammar descriptions in file.y and generates a parser,

## Intro to Lex and [Yacc](Yacc)
Yacc reads the grammar descriptions in bas.y and generates a parser, function
yyparse, in file y.tab.c. Included in file bas.y are token declarations. The â€“d option
causes yacc to generate definitions for tokens and place them in file y.tab.h. Lex reads
the pattern descriptions in bas.l, includes file y.tab.h, and generates a lexical
analyzer, function yylex, in file lex.yy.c.

Finally, the lexer and parser are compiled and linked together to form the executable,

## getchar()
It takes one charecter as input.

## putchar()
It put one charecter as output.
