# Learning Functional Programming
Programming is thinking and Functional Programming will teach you to think very differently. So much so, that you’ll probably never go back to the old way of thinking.
## Forget Everything You Know

People love saying this phrase, but it’s sort of true. *Learning functional programming is like starting from scratch.* Not completely, but effectively. There are lots of similar concepts but it’s best if you just expect that you have to relearn everything.

With the right perspective you’ll have the right expectations and with the right expectations you won’t quit when things get hard.

There are all kinds of things that you’re used to doing as a programmer that you cannot do any more with Functional Programming.

Just like in your car, you used to backup to get out of the driveway. But in a spaceship, there is no reverse. Now you may think, “WHAT? NO REVERSE?! HOW THE HELL AM I SUPPOSED TO DRIVE WITHOUT REVERSE?!”

Well, it turns out that you don’t need reverse in a spaceship because of its ability to maneuver in three dimensional space. Once you understand this, you’ll never miss reverse again. In fact, someday, you’ll think back at how limiting the car really was.
