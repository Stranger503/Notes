Let’s take 2 lots of EURUSD as an example, with leverage of 1:2000.

Lots: 2
Contract size: 100 000 EUR
Leverage size: 2000
Margin = 2 x 100 000 / 2 000 = 100 EUR (margin is always calculated in the base currency).

- Gold and Oil have an inverse correlation with the US dollar (i.e., if gold or oil prices rise, then USD currency weakens and vice versa).
- Gold and Oil have a positive correlation with the Canadian dollar (i.e., if gold or oil prices rise, then CAD currency strengthens and vice versa).

# Currency And Commodity Correlations

		* The Canadian dollar is heavily correlated with commodities, such as crude oil and metals(Gold).
		* The US dollar is heavily negatively correlated with commodities, such as crude oil and metals(Gold).
		* Oil price has a negative impact Japanese Yen(JPY), because japan is a large oil importer.

__CAD/JPY__
Canada is a major exporter of oil, and thus its economy is affected by the price of oil and the amount it can export. Japan is a major importer of oil, and thus the price of oil and the amount it must import affects the Japanese economy. Because of the major effect oil has on Canada and Japan,
Thus the CAD/JPY positively correlates with oil prices.

__The downside is that the CAD/JPY generally has a higher spread and is less liquid than the USD/CAD.__

__Conclusion__
Since oil is priced in U.S. dollars throughout most of the world.Therefore the USD/CAD can also be watched given that the two countries are major oil importers and exporters.

__AUD/USD(Aussie)__
Australia is one of the major gold producers in the world. As a result, its economy is impacted by the price of gold and how much it can export.

New Zealand is a major trading partner with Australia and is thus highly susceptible to fluctuations in Australia's economy.
This means that New Zealand is also highly affected by Australia's relation to gold.

In 2008, Australia was the fourth-largest gold producer in the world. In 2009, the U.S. was the third-largest buyer of gold.

China is a big customer of australain commodities(gold,iron,coal,copper).

The AUD/USD tends to have a negative correlation with the USD/CAD, USD/CHF, and USD/JPY pairs because the AUD/USD is quoted in U.S. dollars, while the others are not.

__Conclusion__
Therefore, the AUD/USD and NZD/USD are suitable for trading in relation to gold prices.
Since Australia is the largest coal and iron ore exporter, the movement of its currency is heavily dependent on commodity prices.

# Notes:
It is also crucial to point out that just because a relationships exists "on average" over time, does not mean that strong correlations exists at all times. While these currency pairs are worth watching for their high correlation tendencies towards a commodity, there will be times when the strong correlation does not exist and may even reverse for some time.

__USD/CAD__
The value of the Canadian dollar is also highly correlated with the price of commodities, especially that of crude oil. Because the Canadian economy is heavily reliant on oil, the price of oil dictates the state of the economy and the currency itself.3

 For this reason, the Canadian dollar is often labelled as a commodity currency.

 __NZD/USD(Kiwi)__
New Zealand markets are the first to open a new trading day.
Agriculture is a major factor in the New Zealand economy; more than two-thirds of the exports are agricultural.

* One particular factor affecting the NZD is the price of dairy. New Zealand is the world's biggest exporter of whole milk powder.
* Tourism is another staple of the New Zealand economy

__USD/JPY(¥)__
* The USD/JPY exchange rate is one of the most liquid and traded currency pairs in the world.
* USD/JPY tends to have a positive correlation with USD/CHF because, aside from the fact that they both use the U.S. dollar as the base currency, the Swiss franc is the other currency that has a safe-haven status with investors.
* The interest rate differential between the Federal Reserve (FED) and the Bank of Japan (BOJ) will affect the value of these currencies when compared to each other. For example, when the Fed intervenes in open market activities to make the U.S. dollar stronger, the value of the USD/JPY cross could increase, due to a strengthening of the U.S. dollar when compared to the Japanese yen.
* In times of market turmoil, investors seek refuge in the Japanese yen.
* On the other side of the coin, the yen tends to weaken when the global economy is strong and stock markets are moving higher. In the post-Recession years, this was evident where the yen slowly lost its value against the U.S. dollar as the global economy recovered.

__USD/CHF__
* The CHF is often viewed as a safe haven due to the country's stable political and financial position.
* The USD/CHF tends to be negatively correlated with the EUR/USD and GBP/USD.
* If the Swiss National Bank raises interest rates, that could lure more investors to the franc and thus increase its value. In this case, the USD/CHF rate would fall because it will take fewer francs to buy the USD.

__Trade Deficit__:
A trade deficit occurs when a country's ___imports___ more than it's ___exports___.

* It's also referred to as a negative balance of trade (BOT).
