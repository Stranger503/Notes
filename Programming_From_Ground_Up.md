# Programming From Ground Up

## Computer Architecture
__Data and Program:__
Von Neumann architecture specifies - Not only computer data should live in memory, but the programs that control the computer's
operation should live there, too.
In fact, in a computer, there is no difference between a program and a program's data except how it is used by the computer.
They are both stored and accessed the same way.

__The CPU:__
Simply storing data doesn't help much we need to do some operations.The CPU reads in instructions from memory one at a time and executes them.
This is known as the ***fetch-execute cycle***. The CPU contains the following elements to accomplish this:

• Program Counter
• Instruction Decoder
• Data bus
• General-purpose registers
• Arithmetic and logic unit
