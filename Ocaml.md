# Ocaml

# A Quick run

- Variables can't be capitalized and can't begin with numbers
	and can't contain dashes(-).
- Digits can have underscore for better readability(ie.100_000 = 100,000)
- Functions in Ocaml are like values, Thats's why we use let keyword.
- Dot notation (.) used to access the function inside the Modules. This is
 different from what you might expect from an object-oriented language, where
 dot-notation is typically used for accessing a method of an object.
- Module names always start with a capital letter. (ie. Printf.printf)
