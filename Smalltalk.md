# Smalltalk Programming


Functions are not called; messages are passed to objects.
objects - Everything is an object; even classes are objects.
class - every class are metaclasses.
messages(What)
method(How)


Important Ideas:

1. there are objects
2. send messages to objects
3. get back an object as the result.

Ex: 2+3
So, 2 + 3 is considered as "sending a message + to object 2, with argument 3 and the result of the message is another object 5"
