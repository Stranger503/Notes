#Turing Completness
==================

Turing-complete is just a name. You can call it Abdul-complete if you want. Names are decided upon historically and are often named after the "wrong" people. It's a sociological process that has no clear criteria. The name has no meaning beyond its official semantics.

Imperative languages are not based on Turing machines. They are based on RAM machines. Your computer is a RAM machine. Turing machines are a nice theoretical model, but they are not a very good model of actual computers.

Programming languages based on other paradigms can be very successful, even though the underlying CPU doesn't support them natively; for example, printers run a stack language. There is more to programming than machine code.


_What the heck is turing Complete anyway ?_

> ***"Turing-complete"  just means  "it can compute whatever a Turing machine can compute."***


_What would be the Equivalent of a Lambda Calculus Machine?_

> A ___Lisp Machine___. Hardware designed specifically to fit the LISP model of computation.
