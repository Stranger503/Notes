I will talk in Indian perspective, stitched clothes were not part of Indian culture. A Saree without fall and without blouse for women while dhoti or lungi( in South) for men. Stitched clothes were for men who went out for wars. Babur has written in his babarnama that women here wear only two clothes and men only one. Which means women must have started wearing blouse due some reasons whether climate or to maintain body shape.

Then came the age of stitched clothes and whole variety of clothes were experimented. Starting from lingerie to jeans so many varieties were available. Now if you observe closely observe in Indian climate long and tight clothes are uncomfortable for both men and women. But for the sake of fashion you wear them. A narrative is set that lungi,dhoti or Saree is old fashioned. Women are the main targets of such narratives because fashion industry relies upon women oriented products. Short clothes means hot women,covered woman means non- attractive woman. No woman wants to be non-attractive so there is a race among women.

Short clothes are available for men too but formally they do not wear it and there is no race among them. Women wear short skirts, two button open shirts in office too. Take an example of Sudha Murti how she was asked to stand in economy class as women in business class thought she must be a poor woman as she was wearing a salwar kameez. Another example is how smoking was marketed as fashion statement for women in America. Today there are women smokers everywhere. Set a narrative, market it and target women,this is how big businesses run.

Market has targeted women and women just are trapped. Observe how they show working women in ads and commercials you will know why women clothes are getting shorter. Another trick is the more shorter the clothes the more will other industries grow like Waxing,laser treatment, fairness products etc.

“Don't question women’s clothes” is another trick of market. In short, Feminism is super hit because it sells.
