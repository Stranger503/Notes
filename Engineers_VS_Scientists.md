# Engineers Vs Scientists

 1. "Scientists are the ones who create the theories, engineers are the ones who implement them."
 2. Scientists observe the world, while engineers focus on creating
 3. In many ways, engineers are simply applied scientists. Scientist go out and discover interesting new phenomena.Engineers scan their publications, and occasionally latch on to one of them.
 4. Scientists explore the natural world and show us how and why it is as it is. ... Engineers innovate solutions to real-world challenges in society.
 5. Science is the study of the physical world, which engineering applies scientific
 6. " Science is about knowledge and engineering is about invention." —Aburo Leusttas
 7. "Science is a lot of high-level theory and engineering is implementation and optimization. Often a Computer Scientist will come up with a plan that a Soft Engineer have to modify because the theory is not realistic enough to be in production. Engineers deal with math, efficiency, and optimization while a Scientist deals with 'what is possible.' A Scientist would be happy spending a million-dollar creating a trinket worth 10 dollars as long as it's good science. An engineer doesn't have that luxury." —Ying (computer scientist & software engineer)
