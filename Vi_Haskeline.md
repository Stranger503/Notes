# Vi-specific bindings
The Vi bindings start in "insert mode" allowing all of the shared commands listed above. If ^D is typed when the line is empty, it is treated as an EOF; otherwise, it is ignored. Pressing ESCAPE enters the "command mode" which provides all of the shared commands except for [printable char] and Tab, allowing instead the following commands:

 - Key	Command
