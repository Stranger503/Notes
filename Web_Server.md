# Web Server a Small Journey

## Part 1


Every client and webserver communicate in terms of HTTP protocols. In order to do that they have to make a perfect http handshake first. In order to achive that they first need to establish a TCP/IP connection between a client and server. In order to do that they need to establish TCP connection using __Sockets__.

* A client can be Browser/Telent.
* A server can written in any language and also can be hostable in any operating system.

__What is a Web Server ?__

1. A Web server is a server that responds to HTTP requests from the Clients. Sending back the response/data the requested.

2. A web server is a piece of software which listens on a network port for incoming HTTP requests and responds to them.


### Note:

___Sockets --> TCP --> HTTP(GET/POST) --> Client___


## Part 2

We have diffrent Web frameworks and diffrent Web servers. Back in the days a Web framework is created for a Specific Web sever. But now we have lots of Web frameworks(flask, django..etc) how are they working seamlessly there have to be a trade off. Like changing codebases for both Web server and Web framewrok.


* These things working seamlessly because __WSGI(Python Web Server Gateway Interface)__.

__Web server vs Web framework__

1. A __web server__ is a physical machine running an Operating System that allows it to serve files via a protocol called HTTP or Hyper Text Transfer Protocol.

2. A __web framework__ is a collection of code written in a specific language which provides the basis for building websites in that language. It generally takes care of all the boilerplate code needed and sets up a structure for writing your code.


__Why we need Web server and Web framework__

1. A __web server__ is a physical machine which is capable of delivering content over internet / intranet.

2. A __web framework__ is a piece of software / library which helps faster development of web applications.

# WSGI

The power of WSGI: It allows you to mix and match your Web servers and Web frameworks. WSGI provides a minimal interface between Python Web servers and Python Web Frameworks.

It‚Äôs very simple and it‚Äôs easy to implement on both the server and the framework side.


__Why we need HTTP Headers?__

The purpose of the headers is to transmit additional information about the HTTP request/response.

__How WSGI server serve requests aimed at WSGI application__

* First, the server starts and loads an ‚Äòapplication‚Äô callable provided by your Web framework/application
* Then, the server reads a request
* Then, the server parses it
* Then, it builds an ‚Äòenviron‚Äô dictionary using the request data
* Then, it calls the ‚Äòapplication‚Äô callable with the ‚Äòenviron‚Äô dictionary and a ‚Äòstart_response‚Äô callable as parameters and gets back a response body.
* Then, the server constructs an HTTP response using the data returned by the call to the ‚Äòapplication‚Äô object and the status and response headers set by the ‚Äòstart_response‚Äô callable.
* And finally, the server transmits the HTTP response back to the client
*

__‚ÄúHow do you make your server handle more than one request at a time?‚Äù__

# Part 3

To answer the above question first we need to understand __How the Web server handling  Client requests?.__

	* It usually respond to requests one at a time(iterative). But if we use a while loop like an infinite loop we can serve any number of requests we want.
	* The Server usually listen the socket. It tells the kernel that it should accept incoming connection requests for this socket and respond.
