signal is a function of two or more  ---- multi dimensional
Chebyshev - elipse
for a two sided sequence the ROC is the entire Z plane except at --- z=0 and z= infinty
z = 0 & z = âˆž
n the overlap -- L+M-1
Multiplication of two DFT s is called as - circular convolution

DSP

Part A
1)5
2)data distributor
3)
4)011
5)1010
6)resistors and transistors respectively
7)


Part B
31)XOR and AND
32)karnaugh map
33)Y=ABCD

he N pint DFT sequence x(n) is given by. ----- option (b)

Part b ---FIR filter is always because all its --- stable
L+M-1 - a
Part b -- by using  the width of the mainlobe  --- Blackman window
Part b !=Two types -- uniform and non uniform

two types of quantitazation are -- uniform and non uniform
FIR filter depend only on the - current and past input
Part a -- impulse invaritant

Part b - impulse invariant
in digitalsystems  ->floating point

will have less effect in cascade  --- output quantatization
in the digital filter implementation is needed ---- scaling
is used for data compression --- DCT
