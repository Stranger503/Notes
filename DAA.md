# What is Computer Science ?
CS is a systematic study of algorithms and data structures. Specifically about the properties of algorithms.

# Properties of Algorithms

1. Formal(Mathematical)
	 Correctness, Design, Analyze
2. Linguistics
	 Transformers(Compilers/Interpreters).
3. Mechanical(Hardware)

# What is Computational Thinking ?
"Solving day to day problems using computer"

# What is Algorithmic Thinking ?
"The Knowledge of how to solve a problem"

# Algorithmics
The Study of algorithms is known as Algorithmics.

1. Design (Solving the problem)
2. Implementing (Program)
3. Analyzing(Space & Time Complexity)

# What is  a Program ?
A Program is an Algorithm expressed in a programming langauge.
