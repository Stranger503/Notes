| p | q | p -> q |
|---|---|--------|
| T | T | T      |
| T | F | F      |
| F | T | T      |
| F | F | T      |

| p | q | p -> q |

__Where did we get this Inputs from?__

	If I study Hard(0)       -- then I will pass(0) == Satisfied with result

	If I study Hard(0)       -- then I don't pass(1) == not satisfied with result

	If I don't study hard(1) -- then I pass(0) == (F**k Yeah I am satisfied)

	If I don't study hard(1) -- then I don't pass(1) == (F**k it, I didn't study so I am satisfied with results )
