Thanks to all those that gave me more suggestions. We are now up to 36. Feel free to suggest more. Also, I might have to revise a couple of these. It would seem that ***Julia has grown concurrency,*** for example, since the last time I looked at it!


1. C: I’m imperative, not functional. Also, I’m faster than you.
2. C++: A bastard child of OOP, functional, procedural and imperative approaches.
3. Haskell: People who talk a lot about me, don’t know me. People who don’t talk a lot about me, don’t know me as well. MONADS!
4. Java: Was once the most popular kid in town, slept with mother’s of all modern languages, except JavaScript’s.
5. C#: I am nothing like C, I am nothing like Java and my name is not C hash.
6. LISP: I am so powerful that using me is a curse [1]
7. CLOJURE: I escaped my father’s curse by having an illicit affair with Java
8. JavaScript: Just like my dad, I am the most popular kid in town, but nothing like my dad.
9. Java: Just to be clear, JavaScript is not my kid.
10. Node: Masking event-loop as concurrency since 2011
11. Node: Do you hate JS in the frontend? Now you can hate it in backend as well.
12. ClojureScript: Just like my dad I am powerful, but I am very unpopular and occasionally sleep with JS.
13. Go: You will use me, because Google wants you to
14. SWIFT: I am no gold digger, but if you want to sleep with me, you do need to buy a MAC.
15. Scala: Java is my legitimate father and I am his smartest kid
16. Kotlin: I hate father’s day, I have too many.
17. Python: You can’t pseudocode me, I am the pseudocode.
18. TypeScript: I am the true Java-Script. I am the rightful heir of Java. I am invincible. I am Microsoft, sorry I meant open-sourced
19. Flow: Facebook wants me to replace Typescript.
20. CoffeeScript: Only if I were JavaScript
21. PHP: I am easy to get, expensive to maintain, frustrating to live with, and impossible to get rid off.
22. Matlab: Was forced upon you as a student, now sell your kidney if you want to continue the relationship.
23. BrainFuck: As the name suggests, I was specifically created to fuck with developer’s mind. Then PHP took over.

24. C: The Boring (and Probably Correct) Choice
25. C++: You Thought It Was Complicated BEFORE
26. Objective-C: Now With Even More Confusing Syntax!
27. C#: You'll Swear It's Not Java
28. Swift: You'll Swear It's Not JavaScript
29. Java: The Practical Choice of Middleware Developers the World Over… And It's ALL Middleware.
30. Java: (Re)Write Once (Every Major Version), Pray Your Containers Still Work.
31. Ruby: Because Programs Should Be Fun, Not Efficient! (_why be efficient when you CAN BE inefficient?)
32. Ruby: The best of Perl shoe-horned into SmallTalk! What could go wrong?
33. Groovy: Easier than getting Ruby to work in the JVM? When you want Rails but can't quit Java…
34. SmallTalk: Passing messages with class since 1972… Basically “That 70s Show” for programming.
35. Python: Including ALL THE BATTERIES (You'll Never Need) Since 1991
36. Python: Because you shouldn't have to pick between functional, procedural, and object-oriented style… in the same file.
37. PHP: Wait, you put HTML, CSS and SQL in here? And we installed this everywhere?
38. PHP: How To Build The Internet in 30 Days or Less… Pocket Edition… for Dummies… with root.
39. JavaScript: Wait, you put HTML, CSS and SQL in here? Again? And installed it everywhere? Literally EVERYWHERE?
40. JavaScript: Single-threaded, natively asynchronous, designed in a week, revised by committee, installed on every modern computer. What could go… Await for it… Promise it's worth it…
41. Go: Do you like prioritizing type and thread safety over readability as much as Google does? We sure hope so!
42. Go: More curly braces than you can shake your parentheses at!
43. Rust: Well, it ain't Go! Way easier than C but still with all the comforting syntax errors you love.
44. Dart: Look, JavaScript is hard to kill, but there are a LOT of Googlers, get it?
45. Typescript: The Java-developer's JavaScript. Now with fewer foot-guns! (Now they're compiler errors…!)
46. Elm: Is this like Lisp or… or not? Is that HTML? Are those leading commas…?
47. Clojure: The Gentleman's Lisp. An elegant weapon for a more civilized time.
48. Clojure: Powering the fastest Middleware ever developed… on the JVM… Since no one uses Scheme.
49. Scheme: Lisp for the 90s. Kinda cool once… like Friends!
50. Erlang: This runs where?
51. Perl: Slightly overused scripting language for free to a good home. Written once, never debugged.
52. Haskell: The Terminal Conclusion of Type Safety as a Design Principle. MONADS EVERYWHERE!
53. Haskel: Useful, well-documented primer for Typescript.
54. Elixir: What if Ruby took over Haskell and made it run Erlang? That's cool, right?
55. Prolog: You OR I may not understand enough to get OR write this title, but with enough input it will work itself out.
56. Kotlin…



57. Java → I am God (Jesus) , i am everywhere.
58. Python → I am water , get mixed easily.
59. JavaScript → I am father of 100’s of framework out there. Respect me.
60. VB Script → I don’t want to be programming language , but they force me (I am Rahul Gandhi of Programming language)
61. Hask → Why i fucking exist.
62. SmallTalk → Introduced OOPS , but people forgot me ooooops.
63. C & C++ → We are old Grandmothers and everybody respect us.
